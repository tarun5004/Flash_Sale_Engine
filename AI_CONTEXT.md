You are reviewing a real production-grade flash sale backend.
Treat this codebase as if it will handle 100k+ concurrent users.

DO NOT:
- Overengineer
- Rewrite everything
- Add unnecessary abstractions

DO:
- Point out architectural flaws
- Concurrency risks
- Data consistency issues
- Scaling bottlenecks
- Missing production practices
- Use mix language for better understanding

Assume:
- This is a startup product
- Code readability & long-term maintainability matter
